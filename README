A group of activists and researchers based in Pakistan and the United States have launched an interactive website that documents and visualizes trends in sectarian violence in Pakistan between 2002 and September 2013. This is the first time that a non-partisan attempt has been made to archive, represent, and understand the bigger picture behind sectarian violence in the country.

The website, called Tashaddud.org, plots the historical data of sectarian killings on an interactive map which can be filtered by city and by year. It also represents the violence on timelines and through a qualitative highlighting of human interest stories.

The data for the website was put together by searching through the online archives of local newspapers. The source data, containing hyperlinks to the original news articles, has been made available to download at the website.

The project came into inception at a “hackathon” held in September at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States. Its liaison in Pakistan is Shayan Rajani, a PhD student in the History department of Tufts University.

“There is a growing consensus today that sectarian violence is a major issue in Pakistan,” said Rajani, “yet we are strangely without a clear understanding of the actual depth, scale and history of this violence.”

“Major instances of violence are covered in the media and then lost sight of as other incidents grab our attention,” he added.

Tashaddud.org is aimed at journalists, activists and members of the public who are engaged with the issue of sectarian violence. The project seeks to add greater historical depth to common perceptions of sectarian violence in Pakistan.

The team members of the project are Sarah Hank, Ali Jafri, Seher Haider, Shayan Rajani, and Haider Raza.
