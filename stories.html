<div id="story"><p><span class="intro">Early in the morning</span> of Thursday, August 16, 2012, a convoy of buses coming from Rawalpindi and headed towards Gilgit, stopped in Manshera district. A group of 50 armed men in commando uniforms boarded the buses and asked passengers for their identity cards. The gunmen, after inspecting the cards, lined up passengers alongside the bus, tied their hands and shot 19 people, almost all of whom were Shia. The attack was claimed by the Taliban. However, other militant groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Jundullah have frequently attacked buses carrying Shia pilgrims from Gilgit and Quetta. <a href="http://x.dawn.com/2012/08/17/19-pulled-out-of-buses-shot-dead-in-sectarian-attack/">Source</a></p></div>

<div id="story"><p><span class="intro">Mufti Nizamuddin Shamzai,</span> a prominent Karachi Sunni cleric was killed in a targeted attack on his car on May 30, 2004. The cleric's car was intercepted by armed men, who opened fire on his vehicle, killing him and injuring his son, nephew and chauffeur outside his house. His death sparked clashes across the city. Mufti Shamzai was associated with Jamia Binoria, one of Pakistan's largest Deobandi madrassas. Many teachers and clerics associated with Jamia Binoria have also been targeted. The police later arrested a member of Sipah-e-Mohammad, a Shia militant group, for Mufti Shamzai's murder. <a href="http://archives.dawn.com/2004/05/31/top3.htm">Source</a></p></div>

<div id="story"><p><span class="intro">In 2002, a young doctor</span> who had recently returned to Pakistan from Canada was shot and killed after dropping his children to school in Karachi. The death of Dr. Alay Safdar Zaidi, an ENT specialist at a local hospital, prompted one of his classmates to flee the country. After his murder, Dr. Zaidi's family received harassing phone calls. A member of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Sunni militant group, was arrested for Dr. Zaidi's murder. Many Shia doctors and professors have been targeted by Sunni militant groups. <a href="http://archives.dawn.com/2002/04/09/local17.htm">Source</a></p></div>

<div id="story"><p><span class="intro">Bombs and subsequent violence</span> at an Ashura procession in Quetta killed 45 people in 2004. Most of the victims belonged to the Hazara community. After the attacks, which were claimed by Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Hazaras refused to bury their dead, demanding that officials at the Anti-Terrorist Force and Frontier Corps be relieved of their duties. The bombing and the Hazara's subsequent protest were remarkable precursors to the Hazara Town blasts in January and February 2013 when 93 and 84 Hazaras were killed, respectively. <a href="http://archives.dawn.com/2004/03/04/top1.htm">Source</a></p></div>
